    <br><br>
   <h5> What's different about us? </h5>
    
    What makes AutoPortal a well rounded and quality product is its segmentation approach towards multiple aspects that bind the automotive media together. At the forefront is the extensive catalogue of cars that are currently on sale in India, complete with details about variants, expert reviews, images and video gallery, ex-showroom prices in various cities across the country, even insurance & finance options, and lucrative offers.

    <br><br>
    <h5>Our history in a nutshell </h5>
    
    AutoPortal has its roots back in the East European nation of Ukraine (www.autoportal.ua). After successfully taking the market by storm there and becoming one of most sought after online spaces in the automobile sector, Anton Rublevskyy, one of the founders of the hub, decided to foray into other emerging markets. India was collectively and quickly decided upon, owing to the huge potential this country portrays in the auto sector and the absence of a well-organised and credible medium on which, this huge market can rely upon to get the accurate and first-hand information.
    <br><br>

    <h5> Milestones achieved so far </h5>

    AutoPortal.com rose to this challenge and started its Indian innings back in November 2013. In this short span, AutoPortal.com quickly shot to fame and has successfully managed to carve itself a niche space in the Indian automotive segment - receiving rave reviews from our readers as well as the auto industry, thanks to the dedicated efforts of its young and talented automotive enthusiasts and our entire readership.
    <br><br>
    Whether you are in the market for a new car or a used car, an enthusiast passing by for news, updates or video content, a journalist working on a story or a job seeker, we sincerely hope that you find what youâ€™re looking for at AutoPortal.com.</p>
